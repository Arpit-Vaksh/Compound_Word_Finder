# Compound_Word_Finder

This is a Python program that finds the longest and second-longest compound words from a list of words in a text file.

# Usage
Using the provided text file named "Input_01.txt" and "Input_02.txt" with a list of words.
Run the Python script compound_word_finder.py.
The program will read the words from the file, find the longest and second-longest compound words, and display the results along with the time taken to process the input file.

# How It Works
The program uses a recursive approach to determine if a word is a compound word. It checks if the word can be divided into two or more smaller words from the given list.
